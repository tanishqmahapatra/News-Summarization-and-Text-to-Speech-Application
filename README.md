# News Summarization and Text-to-Speech Application

## Objective
This project is a web-based application that extracts key details from multiple news articles related to a given company, performs sentiment analysis, conducts a comparative analysis, and generates a text-to-speech (TTS) output in Hindi.

## Features
1. **News Extraction**: Extracts and displays the title, summary, and metadata from at least 10 news articles using `BeautifulSoup`.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) of the extracted news articles.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compares the sentiment across multiple articles to provide insights on the coverage.
4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the summarized content into Hindi speech using an open-source TTS model.
5. **User Interface**: Built using `Gradio` for an interactive user experience.
6. **API Development**: A REST API-based architecture to handle requests and responses.
7. **Deployment**: Hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces** for easy accessibility.
